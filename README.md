# Net-Worth

This is a net worth calculator that is built using following:

1. Node.js
2. mongo-db
3. html
4. css

The overall goal is to allow for users to manually inserts both their assets and debts, and label/categorize them appropriately. It currently supports the following assets:

1. Investments
2. Cryptocurrency
3. Cash
4. Miscellaneous Assets

Current status is not quite complete, but working examples of insertion of assets, auto-updating of the various charts (Overall asset pie chart with clickable slices, overall net worth plot with a moving average and asset change) and various forms and formatting on the main page. There still requires some polish, implementation of debt, and various other smaller things.
